Welcome to Alfheim light code editor theme, crafted with a focus on clarity and visibility. Theme designed to offer a clean and distraction-free environment for coding. With minimal accents, the interface ensures that your code remains the main focus.

Simple color scheme was chosen to reduce eye strain, especially for long coding sessions during daylight. The design incorporates calm contrasts to help distinguish between different elements without requiring you to increase the monitor brightness.
